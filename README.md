## How to use

The project demonstrates the possibilities of using React.

Using the search engine, you can find the job you are interested in by typing, for example, "css" or "angular". Then you can add the offer you are interested in to your bookmarks. If you restart the site, the bookmarks will remain, and the ad you are interested in will be downloaded not from the server, but from the local storage.
